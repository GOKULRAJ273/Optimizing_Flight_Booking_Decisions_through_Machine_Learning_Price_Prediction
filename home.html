        <h1><strong>Flight Price Prediction</strong></h1>
        <br>
        <h3>
            The objective of this article is to predict flight prices given the various parameters. This will be a regression<br>
            problem since the target or dependent variable is the price (continuous numeric value) Nowadays, the<br>
            number of people using fights has increased significantly. It is difficult for airlines to maintain prices since<br>
            prices change dynamically due to different conditions. That's why we will try to use machine learning to<br>
            solve this problem. This can help airlines by prdicting what prices they can maintain. It can also help<br>
            customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.
